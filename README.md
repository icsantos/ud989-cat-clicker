## Requirements

### Visuals
The application should display two cats. Each cat includes
- the cat's name
- a picture of the cat
- text showing the number of clicks

The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

### Interaction
The number of clicks should increment when each cat picture is clicked.
